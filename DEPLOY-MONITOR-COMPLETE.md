## üöÄ Quick Deploy (3 Steps)

### Railway (Easiest)

1. **Go to Railway:**
   - https://railway.app
   - Sign up with GitHub

2. **Deploy:**
   - New Project ‚Üí Deploy from GitHub
   - Select `mailmind` repo
   - Railway auto-detects Node.js

3. **Add Environment Variables:**
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://mudasir434:mudasir434@cluster0.nzpepop.mongodb.net/
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
   GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/api/gmail/callback
   GEMINI_API_KEY=
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

4. **Update Google Console:**
   - Add Railway URL to authorized redirect URIs
   - Replace `YOUR-APP` with your actual Railway URL

**Done! Your API is live! üéâ**

## üìä Monitoring Setup

### 1. UptimeRobot (Free Monitoring)

1. Go to: https://uptimerobot.com
2. Add monitor:
   - URL: `https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/health`
   - Interval: 5 minutes
3. Add email alerts

**Result:** Get notified when app goes down

### 2. GitHub Actions (Included)

Already configured:
- Hourly health checks
- Automatic alerts on failure

**To enable:**
- Add `APP_URL` secret to GitHub repo
- Value: Your production URL

### 3. Railway Dashboard

Built-in monitoring:
- CPU/Memory usage
- Response times
- Logs
- Deployment history

**Access:** Railway dashboard ‚Üí Your service

## üß™ Test Health Endpoints

Once deployed:

```bash
# Basic health
curl https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/health

# Detailed health (with DB stats)
curl https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/health/detailed

# Metrics
curl https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/health/metrics
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-31T...",
  "database": {
    "status": "connected",
    "healthy": true
  },
  "stats": {
    "users": 1,
    "summaries": 5,
    "gmailConnections": 1
  },
  "performance": {
    "responseTime": "45ms",
    "memory": {
      "used": "64MB",
      "total": "128MB"
    }
  }
}
```
