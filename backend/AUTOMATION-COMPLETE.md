# 🎉 Scheduled Automation - Complete!

## ✅ What We Built

### 1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/daily-email-summary.yml`)
- Runs automatically every day at 8:00 AM UTC
- Can be triggered manually from GitHub Actions tab
- Supports custom user ID and max emails via inputs
- Handles all environment variables securely via GitHub Secrets

### 2. **Daily Summarization Script** (`src/scripts/daily-summarize.ts`)
- Processes all users with Gmail connected (or specific user if provided)
- Fetches latest emails (default: 20 per user)
- Filters out already-summarized emails (no duplicates!)
- Summarizes with AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash)
- Stores in MongoDB
- Rate limiting (4 seconds between requests)
- Detailed logging and error handling
- Summary report at the end

### 3. **NPM Script** (`package.json`)
- `npm run summarize` - Run automation locally
- Environment variables: `USER_ID`, `MAX_EMAILS`

---

## 🧪 Testing Results

✅ **Script tested locally** with your user ID

## 📊 Features

### ✅ Smart Processing
