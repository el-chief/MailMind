# üìã MailMind ‚Äî Project Scope Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** Draft

## üéØ Project Vision

**MailMind** is a personal AI assistant that automatically reads, summarizes, and organizes your emails daily ‚Äî completely private and free to use.

### Core Problem

### Solution
An automated system that:
- Connects to your Gmail account securely
- Fetches new emails daily
- Uses AI to generate concise, meaningful summaries
- Presents summaries in a clean, searchable dashboard
- Optionally sends daily digests via Telegram/Discord
